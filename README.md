# Demonstration of the Scone newsfeed API

This small project is used to demonstrate how the Scone newsfeed API works.

To use it, check out the project and run the following

```bash
npm install
node demo.js <token> [ <locale> ]
```

Where `<token>` is the authentication token provided by Scone, and `<locale>` 
is one of the supported locales (`en-US`, `nl-NL` etc).
